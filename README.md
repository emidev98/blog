# [Diesel ORM (Objectâ€“relational mapping)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping)

This is the framework that will be used to connect to the DB. Here you have a collection of examples that you can apply to your own project in case it's needed:

## Migrations

Migrations are useful too keep track of all changes on the DB done from outside the (micro)-service. Modern ORM's have the migrations integrated into the framework. We will define the following migrations:

> blog/migrations/2022-07-07-0_create_posts/up.sql
```SQL
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    slug VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL
)
```

> blog/migrations/2022-07-07-0_create_posts/down.sql
```SQL
DROP TABLE posts;
```

With the following command you can execute the *up.sql* migrations to progressively modify the DB forward:
```
diesel migration run
```

This following command will do the opposite of the previous one which means that will execute the *down.sql* with the concept of re-doing what the previous command created.
```
diesel migration redo
```

## Models

If you executed the previous commands you may see that inside **blog/srrc/schemas.rs** you may have a macro created with posts name. That will be useful to do requests to the DB. Remebebr that you need to have a connection to the DB that will be stored into the **blog/.env** file with the nam DATABASE_URL.

Create the following models. They will allow you to interact with the databse from Rust native without having to know much about SQL:

> blog/src/models.rs
```rust
#[derive(Queryable, Debug)]
pub struct Post {
    pub id: i32,
    pub title: String,
    pub slug: String,
    pub body: String
}

#[derive(Queryable, Debug)]
pub struct SimplifiedPost {
    pub title: String,
    pub body: String
}

use super::schema::posts;

#[derive(Insertable)]
#[table_name="posts"]
pub struct NewPost<'a> {
    pub title: &'a str,
    pub body: &'a str,
    pub slug: &'a str
}
```
*Checking the details you can see that there are some attributes defind ffor the data strcutres like `Queryable, Insertable and table_name="posts"`, these attributes allow you to interact with the DB using the native Rust models.

## Insert

Now that everything is configured lets insert some data to be able to play with it. If you follow the next code the most important takes is that it loads the **db_url** from the **.env** file, creates the DB connection and sends the connection to the diesel framework to insert the data:

> blog/src/main.rs
```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate diesel;

pub mod models;
pub mod schema;

use diesel::associations::HasTable;
use dotenv::dotenv;
use std::env;

use diesel::prelude::*;
use diesel::pg::PgConnection;

fn main() {
    dotenv().ok();

    let db_url = env::var("DATABASE_URL")
        .expect("ERROR:> DABASE URL NOT FUND IN .env FILE");

    let db_conn = PgConnection::establish(&db_url)
        .expect("ERROR:> Cannot connect to the databse");

    use self::schema::posts::dsl::*;
    use self::models::{Post, NewPost, SimplifiedPost};
    
    let new_post = NewPost {
        title: "First post",
        body: "Lorem ipsum",
        slug: "first-post"
    };

    diesel::insert_into(posts::table)
        .values(new_post)
        .get_result::<Post>(&db_conn)
        .expect("ERROR:> Failed to insert data into DB");
}
```
*Insert multiple rows that way you have a larger dataset that you can interact with.

## Query

The following examples asumes that everything is correctly imported into main.rs. To use this pieces of code place them in main.rs below the insert.

```rs
// SELECT * FROM posts
let posts_res = posts
    .load::<Post>(&db_conn)
    .expect("ERROR:> Posts cannot be retreived from DB");

// Display all posts into debug mode
for post in posts_res {
    println!("{:?}", post);
}
```

```rs
// SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT 1
let post_res = posts
    .limit(1)
    .load::<Post>(&db_conn)
    .expect("ERROR:> Posts cannot be retreived from DB");

for post in post_res {
    println!("{:?}", post);
}
```

```rs
/*
    SELECT * 
        FROM posts 
        ORDER BY id DESC
        LIMIT 1
*/
let post_with_order_res = posts
    .order(id.desc())
    .limit(1)
    .load::<Post>(&db_conn)
    .expect("ERROR:> Posts cannot be retreived from DB");

for post in post_with_order_res {
    println!("{:?}", post);
}
```

```rs
// SELECT * FROM posts WHERE slug = 'second-post'
let posts_with_where_res = posts
    .filter(slug.eq("second-post"))
    .load::<Post>(&db_conn)
    .expect("ERROR:> Posts cannot be retreived from DB");

for post in posts_with_where_res {
    println!("{:?}", post);
}
```

```rs
// SELECT title, body FROM posts
let simplified_posts_res = posts
    .select((title, body))
    .load::<SimplifiedPost>(&db_conn)
    .expect("ERROR:> Posts cannot be retreived from DB");

for post in simplified_posts_res {
    println!("{:?}", post);
}
```

*As you can observe from the previous examples is very similar to SQL without the necessity to write SQL code since the OEM auogenerates the queries.

## Update

The following example will update the title of a post by filtering by id. Due the nature of id being an incremental serial, a unique entry from the database can be queried back and displayed without having to loop over it like in the queries examples:

```rust
let post_update_res: Post = diesel::update(posts.filter(id.eq(2)))
        .set(title.eq("Second Post"))
        .get_result(&db_conn)
        .expect("ERROR:> Update error");

println!("Display updated post {:?}",post_update_res);

```

## Delete

This following statement will delete all posts where slug ends with "-post" which means that if you have had imported as by the pattern of "first-post", "second-post", "third-post"... will delete al data from the database.

```rust
diesel::delete(posts.filter(slug.like("%-post%")))
    .execute(&db_conn)
    .expect("ERROR:> Something went wrong trying to delete registers");
```
